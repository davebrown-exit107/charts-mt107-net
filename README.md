This is my personal lab repo. Mostly going to be things I run on my cluster but I'm open to requests!

## Goals/TODOs

- [ ] Automatically update when new versions of mealie are deployed
- [ ] Auto creation of READMEs with values populated and such
- [ ] CI/CD for all of the above
- [ ] Better looking landing page for the repo on the GitHub Pages side

# mt107.net Helm Charts

## Usage

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.
Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add mt107-net https://davebrown-exit107.github.io/charts-mt107-net
```

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve the latest versions of the packages.

You can then run `helm search repo mt107-net` to see the charts.
